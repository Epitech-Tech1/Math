# 103cipher

Epitech Project, Third mathematical project

## Subject

Cryptography is a very old science, whose goal is to secure communication, so that only its recipient could read it.
There are a lot of methods to encrypt a message, from the simplest (such as the 2,000-year-old Caesar cipher) to the most complex (such as the World War 2 Enigma code); they all need both encryption and decryption keys (sometimes identical).
In some cases (such as the Hill cipher), the key is represented by a matrix.

## Usage

./103cipher “Just because I don’t care doesn’t mean I don’t understand.” “Homer S” 0
