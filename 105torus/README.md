# 105torus

Epitech project, Five mathematical project

## Subject

Drawing circles, cylinders and cones is a good start for an image synthesis software, but one have to admit it is not fully satisfying. . . This project is the continuation of the previous one, and should allow you to draw more complex forms, such as a torus, which do not emerge from 2nd degree equations, but from superior degree equations (4th degree in the torus case).
The objective of this project is to solve a 4th degree equation: a4x4 + a3x3 + a2x2 + a1x1 + a0 = 0. A direct resolution method does exist (Ferrariâ€™s method), but does not generalize to higher degrees.
